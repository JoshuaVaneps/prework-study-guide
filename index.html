        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li> 
          <li>external CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file</li> 
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a <link> element placed in the HTML's <head>, as shown in the following code:</li> 
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. </li> 
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. </li> 
          <li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li> 
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
          <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of however many pixels you designate and you also get to designate the color</li>
          <li>a link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
          <li> Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
