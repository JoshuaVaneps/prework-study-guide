        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li> 
          <li>external CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file</li> 
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a <link> element placed in the HTML's <head>, as shown in the following code:</li> 
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. </li> 
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. </li> 
          <li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li> 
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
          <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of however many pixels you designate and you also get to designate the color</li>
          <li>a link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
          <li> Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>String -  a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li>Boolean - This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.
            (let myVariable = true;)
            </li>
          <li>Array	- This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.
            (let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
            Refer to each member of the array like this:
            myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.)
            </li>
          <li>strict equality - This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (===)	(let myVariable = 3; myVariable === 4;)
          </li>
          <li>Not, Does-not-equal	- This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.	!, !==
          </li>
          <li>Conditionals - are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>if statement - a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>Array -  group of related data stored in a variable
          </li>
          <li>Index - Location of the data of items in an array; first item is always 0</li>
          <li>for loop - uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code - makes it inactive without deleting it,  To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code</li>
